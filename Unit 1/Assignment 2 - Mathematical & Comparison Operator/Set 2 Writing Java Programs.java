- Submit the replit link

1. **Basic Calculator:**
    
    Create a Java program that acts as a simple calculator. It should take in two numerical inputs and an operator (+, -, *, /). Based on these inputs, it should perform the operation and print the result. Handle the possible exceptions like division by zero.
    
2. **Temperature Converter:**
